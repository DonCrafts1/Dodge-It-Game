**Dodge It**

A C++ NCurses game, where you try to survive dodging fast projectiles (currently only falling) for a certain period of time.
The projectiles collide with each other, and may knock you away if hit, so be careful, and **dodge it**!

_Project Details_
This is still an ongoing project. I plan to add more types of enemies, and possibly an attack system.
The game uses a game loop to update all of its components, and properly deallocates memory (well, at least it should ;D)
Run 'make' to compile the program. If you are on Windows, change the .EXE in the Makefile to = "game.exe". Then run "./game" or "./game.exe"!
