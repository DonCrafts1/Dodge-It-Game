**Dodge It**

A C++ NCurses game, where you try to survive dodging fast projectiles (currently only falling) for a certain period of time.
The projectiles collide with each other, and may knock you away if hit, so be careful, and **dodge it**!

_Project Details_

The project implements a game loop, an object (memory) management system, physics (collisions), and more.

Be sure to have installed ncurses on your machine. If you are on Mac/Linux it should be installed already. If you're on Windows, you may need to install ncurses.
If you are using mingw64, take a look at this for installation: https://packages.msys2.org/packages/mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-ncurses

Run 'make' to compile the program. Then run "./game" or "./game.exe"!

The window size should be 100 x 50.
